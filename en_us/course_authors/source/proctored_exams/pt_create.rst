After you enable proctored exams for your course, you can create a proctored
exam using your choice of either RPNow or Proctortrack. To create a proctored
exam for Proctortrack, you first create an Onboarding subsection in your course,
and then create a proctored exam subsection.

*****************************************
Creating an Onboarding Subsection
*****************************************


Proctortrack requires all learners to complete an onboarding process before 
they take a proctored exam. In the onboarding process, learners download and
install the necessary client software and verify their identity with 
Proctortrack.

To set up Proctortrack onboarding for a course, follow these steps.

#. Add and :ref:`develop a subsection <Developing Course Subsections>` as you
   would any other subsection.

   Learners must complete onboarding at least two days before they attempt the 
   proctored exam, so you should position the onboarding subsection at an early
   stage in your course.

#. Select the **Configure** icon for the subsection.

   The **Settings** dialog box opens to the **Basic** tab.

#. In the **Grading** section, set the :ref:`assignment type and due date<Set
   the Assignment Type and Due Date for a Subsection>` for the subsection.

#. Select the **Advanced** tab, and then locate the **Set as a Special Exam**
   section.

#. Select the exam type to **Onboarding**.

#. Select **Save**.
