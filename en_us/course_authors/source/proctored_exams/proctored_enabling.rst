Enable Proctored Exams
########################################

To create a proctored exam, you modify the course advanced settings in Studio
to enable proctored exams, and then you modify the settings of a subsection to
specify that the subsection is a proctored exam.

To enable proctored exams in your course, follow these steps.

#. In Studio, select **Settings**, then select **Advanced Settings**.

#. Locate the **Enable Proctored Exams** policy key. The default value is
   ``false``.

#. Change the value of the setting to ``true``.

#. Locate the **Proctoring Provider** policy key. To use the RPNow proctoring
   software, set the value of this setting to ``software_secure``. To use the 
   Proctortrack proctoring software, set the value of this setting to 
   ``proctortrack``.

#. Select **Save Changes**. You can now create proctored exams in your course.

After you enable this setting for your course, you can create a proctored exam
or a practice proctored exam, using the third-party proctoring software that 
you chose in step 4.
