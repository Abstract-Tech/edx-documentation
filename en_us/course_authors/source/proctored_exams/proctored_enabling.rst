To create a proctored exam, you modify the course advanced settings in Studio
to enable proctored exams, and then you modify the settings of a subsection to
specify that the subsection is a proctored exam.

.. note:: In Fall 2019, the default proctoring provider is **RPNow** by PSI. 
   To use **Proctortrack** by Verificient, please contact your edX partner manager.

To enable proctored exams in your course, follow these steps.

#. In Studio, select **Settings**, then select **Advanced Settings**.

#. Locate the **Enable Proctored Exams** policy key. The default value is
   ``false``.

#. Change the value of the setting to ``true``.

#. Select **Save Changes**. You can now create proctored exams in your course.


After you enable this setting for your course, you can create a proctored exam
or a practice proctored exam.
